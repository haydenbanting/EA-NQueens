# Evolutionary Algoirthm to find Solutions to the 8 Queens Problem

The 8 Queens problem asks to find an arrangement of 8 queens on an 8x8 chess board in which no queen 'checks' another.

The user can tune several algorithm parameters:

\tgrid_size - size of the grid (this solution is generalized, not exclusively 8x8)\n
\tpop_size - size of the population of candidate solutions\n
\tnum_parents - number of parents to use in the selection phase\n
\tnum_offspring - number of offspring produced each generation\n
\tcrossover_rate - chance an offspring obtains geno from both parents\n
\tmutation_rate - chance of mutation per generation per offsrping\n
\tmax_generations - stop after this number of generations if no solution is found\n
  
Also some options to see various prints and plots about the process.
