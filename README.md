# Evolutionary Algoirthm to find Solutions to the 8 Queens Problem

The 8 Queens problem asks to find an arrangement of 8 queens on an 8x8 chess board in which no queen 'checks' another.

The user can tune several algorithm parameters:

  grid_size - size of the grid (this solution is generalized, not exclusively 8x8)
  pop_size - size of the population of candidate solutions
  num_parents - number of parents to use in the selection phase
  num_offspring - number of offspring produced each generation
  crossover_rate - chance an offspring obtains geno from both parents
  mutation_rate - chance of mutation per generation per offsrping
  max_generations - stop after this number of generations if no solution is found
  
Also some options to see various prints and plots about the process.
